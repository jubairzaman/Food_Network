            <h1>Some Fitness tips</h1>
            <p>Exercise daily for at least an hour. You do not have to kill yourself from running, jogging, etc., but
                you should have some sort of moderate physical activity in your everyday life. If you're looking to shed
                a few pounds fast, do a higher-level intensity workout. For example, go on a walk at a brisk pace for an
                hour. Or, you can jog and set certain intervals to sprint during that hour. </p>

            <p>Not only does oatmeal make a delicious breakfast, but the soluble fiber promotes heart health and
                controls dips in blood sugar. A small bowl with fresh fruit makes a terrific pre-workout meal.</p>
